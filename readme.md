# *Welcome* to the dwyl website!

It's as ever a work in progress, so please don't hesitate to [share your ideas](https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues) on how to make it better!

The current version is built by [@hdrdavies] and [@mantagen] but you can see the evolution here: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues/143 .

## How?

To run this site on your localhost, simply ***install*** the *dependencies* from npm and then ***start*** it:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000


## Background

We are migrating from using GitHub Pages to using a little ***Open Source CMS***
we are building: [***adoro***](https://github.com/dwyl/adoro).
