# *Welcome* to the dwyl website!

It's as ever a work in progress, so please don't hesitate to [share your ideas](https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl-site/issues) on how to make it better!

The current version is built by [@hdrdavies] and [@mantagen] but you can see the evolution here: https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl-site/issues/143 .

## How?

To run this site on your localhost, simply ***install*** the *dependencies* from npm and then ***start*** it:

```sh
npm install && npm start
```

Then visit: http://localhost:3000


## Background

We are migrating from using GitHub Pages to using a little ***Open Source CMS***
we are building: [***adoro***](https://github.com/dwyl/adoro).

## Team

The members information are saved in the members.json. If you need to add or reorganise the list of members displayed on the website, you just need to modify or change the order of the json member objects in the members.json file.
